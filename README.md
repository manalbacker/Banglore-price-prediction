# Bangalore Price Prediction

This repository contains a project focused on predicting real estate prices in Bangalore using data science and machine learning techniques.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to analyze and predict property prices in Bangalore based on various features. The project leverages Jupyter Notebook as the main environment for data exploration, cleaning, feature engineering, and building predictive models.

## Features

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering
- Model building and evaluation for price prediction
- Visualization of key insights

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Popular data science libraries (e.g., pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn)

## Getting Started
